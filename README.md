# Aseflow Website

A responsive website for Aseflow - India's First Liquid Protein Shot.

## Description
I'm currently working as an intern at Aseflow, a startup company where I have the opportunity to be the first employee and intern.
This project is a company portfolio website I developed as part of my real-time internship experience, showcasing the brand, services, and vision of Aseflow.
I was involved in every stage — from UI design to deploying the site live using Render with a custom domain (www.aseflow.com).
This project reflects my learning, creativity, and growth as a developer in a startup environment.

This website is built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It showcases Aseflow, a liquid protein shot product that delivers 25g of protein in a convenient 40ml shot, available in both marine and vegan options.
